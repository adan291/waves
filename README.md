## 🎯 What is Whispers of the Wave?

Whispers of the Wave is an **introspective experience** that uses AI to help you explore your thoughts and emotions in a safe, calming environment. It's not a traditional game—it's a **digital space for reflection**, inspired by the therapeutic power of the ocean.

Think of it as a conversation with the sea itself. You share what's on your mind, and the waves respond with gentle reflections that help you see your thoughts from new perspectives.

### Why the Ocean?

The ocean has long been a symbol of the unconscious mind in psychology. Its waves represent the ebb and flow of emotions—sometimes calm, sometimes turbulent, but always in motion. This experience uses that metaphor to create a space where:

- **Thoughts can surface** like bubbles rising from the deep
- **Emotions can flow** without judgment
- **Clarity can emerge** like the horizon after a storm

## 🌀 The Four Waves

Choose your wave based on what you need:

| Wave | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| 🌊 **Calm Wave** | Gentle self-discovery | When you need peace and soft guidance |
| 🌀 **Deep Wave** | Philosophical exploration | When you want to dive into deeper questions |
| ⚡ **Energetic Wave** | Action and clarity | When you need momentum and practical insights |
| 💙 **Healing Wave** | Emotional support | When you're processing difficult feelings |

Each wave has its own AI persona, visual atmosphere, and conversation style—all designed to match your current emotional needs.

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Choose your wave** - Select the emotional atmosphere that resonates with you
2. **Share your thoughts** - Type whatever is on your mind, no judgment
3. **Receive reflections** - The AI responds with two parts:
   - *Whisper*: A poetic, empathetic acknowledgment
   - *Wave of Reflection*: A deeper question or insight to explore
4. **Watch the ocean respond** - The background subtly shifts based on the emotional tone of your conversation

### The Ocean Responds to You

The visual environment isn't just decoration—it's feedback. As you converse:
- The **wave speed** changes with emotional intensity
- The **colors** stay within your chosen wave's palette
- The **atmosphere** reflects your journey from confusion to clarity
